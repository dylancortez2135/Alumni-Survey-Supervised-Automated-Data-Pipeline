# Alumni-Survey-Supervised-Automated-Data-Pipeline

This project demonstrates a supervised automated data pipeline that automatically ingests raw batches of alumni survey data, transforms them, and loads the cleaned results into a live dashboard.

## 📌 Overview

This is a synthetic version of a real, on-going project that aims to provide a Data Pipeline that converts batches of survey data into actionable and data-backed insights. All process — from data ingestion to the creation of the dashboard — are all automatic except one supervised step: Running the Glue Job (Main Transformation) to ensure reliability and cost efficiency.

## 🧠 Objectives

The survey collects responses from a local University’s alumni to assess demographics and post-graduation performance metrics.
It aims to provide insights into the University’s overall teaching proficiency and career impact by exploring these key questions

  1. Which college degree graduates performed the best?
  2. Which campus produces the most excellent employees?
  3. Which department does DMC Academy produce the most employees in, and what’s their average rating?
  4. What are the top job roles alumni drift into?
  5. Who are the top 100 employees per department?
